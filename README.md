## Find Treasure inside CASTLE

=> This is "Find Treasure inside CASTLE" game. Here, I used conditionals such as `if`, `else`, and `elif` statements to lay out the logic and the story's path in the program. 
 
=> Also I used `input` statement to take inputs from users also I used `f-string` to mention Player name inside some of the Commands.

=> This Game is developed by using python only.

### Story Line of the GAME

* "Does user wanna play the game? Y or N."
* "If N, then user should come again and try this game.This game is totally full of fun."
* "Now, if user choose to play game then he/she start from the main door."
* "You have 4 Options means 4 rooms from which user can choose whichever he/she wants."
* "In Room1 there is hungry LION who will it the player definitely."
* "Tn Room2 there are again 2 rooms inside it i.e. Left and Right."
* "But Both rooms doesn't contain TREASURE so it is game over for user."
* "If user chooses Room3 then also the game is over for user because that room is full of snakes instead of treasure."
* "Now Only remaining option is Room4 so definitely the treasure is here. But Wait a Minute.....Is it really that's simple?"
* "Inside Room4 there are again 2 rooms(Left one and Right one). Left room is full of dynamites while Right room is full of TREASURE."
* "If user chooses right room, then he/she will win all the treasure and successfully complete the game."
